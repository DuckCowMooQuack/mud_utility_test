### Manual

Copy this directory into Home Assistant:

```text
custom_components/mud_utility_test
```

After copying, restart Home Assistant and add `MUD Utilities Test` from the integrations UI.

## Configuration

You need:

- M.U.D. customer portal username or email.
- M.U.D. customer portal password.
- Gas contract ID.
- Water contract ID.

The contract IDs are visible in your M.U.D. account. They are not included in this repository and must be entered by each user during setup.

## Plotly Examples

Optional Plotly Graph Card examples are available in `examples/plotly`.

These cards use the `billing_history` sensor attribute exposed by this integration and require the separate Plotly Graph Card custom card. Fresh installs should create test entity IDs such as `sensor.mud_utilities_test_gas_consumption` and `sensor.mud_utilities_test_water_consumption`; adjust them if your Home Assistant instance creates different entity IDs.

## Privacy

This integration stores your M.U.D. username, password, and contract IDs in Home Assistant's config entry storage. Do not share diagnostics or configuration files that contain those values.

## Notes

This is an unofficial integration and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Metropolitan Utilities District.

The integration imports billing-cycle records into Home Assistant long-term statistics using statistic IDs such as `mud_utility_test:gas_consumption` and `mud_utility_test:water_consumption`.
